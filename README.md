## Hi there 👋, I'm Marcelo

### I have been teaching english for 10 years. When I turned thirty three I realized that I wanted to use my english skills as a tool and not as the main focus of my labor. So now I crave for an opportunity to learn, gather experience and develop myself in this amazing field of programming. A total career change.

## Skills
* 📱  Flutter
* 🌐 .NET
* 🔵 C#
* 📦 SQL Server
* 💻 HTML, CSS, JS


- 🌱 I’m currently learning Firebase 🔥
