## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Marcelo

### I am a former English instructor that has found himself passionate about information technology. I am a mobile developer focused almost entirely on Flutter. Building structures and beautiful screens is very pleasant to me. Going to my second year of experience in the field, I have nothing but high expectations for 2022 and the opportunities that it'll bring.
