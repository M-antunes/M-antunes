## Hi there 👋, I'm Marcelo

### I have been teaching english for 10 years. When I turned thirty three I realized that I wanted to use my english skills as a tool and not as the main focus of my labor. So now I crave for an opportunity to learn, gather experience and develop myself in this amazing field of programming. A total career change.
